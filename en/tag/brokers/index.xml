&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, politicians at different levels cooperate to achieve electoral and governing goals. Recently, these relationships have come to be analyzed through theories of brokers developed in comparative politics. This article investigates the micro-foundations of alliances between state representatives and local politicians and asks to what extent those theories are adequate to analyze these relationships in Brazil. Our analysis combines data from surveys with state representatives and interviews with advisors and focuses on how alliances are built, maintained, and broken. We show that mayors and city councilors are important brokers for state representatives. However, the fact that legislators and local brokers do not hold static positions and play dual roles underscores the limits of principal-agent theories to describe and analyze these relationships. Based on our conclusions, we suggest pathways to advance our understanding of the dynamics of interest intermediation and the multilevel connections between political actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Note: each respondent is counted twice, because a legislator gives an answer for both the most important support and the second most important.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Hoyler, Telma; Gelape, Lucas; Silotto, Graziele. 2021. The construction of political-territorial ties: evidence from of São Paulo. &lt;strong&gt;Opinião Pública&lt;/strong&gt;, Campinas, v. 27, n. 2, p. 549–584. (In Portuguese)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current interpretations on the inner workings of Brazilian city councils are rooted in the scholarly debate of national politics. In the latter, the presence of legislation proposals with territorial goals and concentrated electoral voting patterns are the main evidence of distributivism/clientelism. We argue, however, that such characteristics of legislative and electoral politics at the national level are ill-suited proxies for analysis of the local level, failing to capture nuances of political mobilization in cities. Instead, by means of a mixed-methods analysis of an instrument called representatives’ requests – in-depth interviews, participant observation, and local spatial autocorrelation hypothesis tests – we argue that city councilors&amp;rsquo; geographically targeted actions take place through a capillary and rooted structure of brokers that feeds back and creates ties throughout local mandates and voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure: Lisa (Local Moran) from the number of representative&amp;rsquo;s requests by district &amp;ndash; councilors Dalton Silvano (13ª legislature) e Gilson Barreto (11ª legislature)&lt;/strong&gt;
